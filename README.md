Hi, my name is Princess Eve Santiago. A 3rd year BSIT student and currently taking up Information Technology at Central Philippine University.

Five things about me are the following:
a. I like to learn new things especially if these fields are onn technology.
b. I am a book-holic wherein I tend to impulsively hoard books with different genre.
c. I spent a lot of time figuring out sometime what to eat especially if I wan tto dine outside.
d. I tend to try different cafe branches or lets say I want cafe hunting everytime I'm in the mood of drinking coffee
e. And horror movies will always keep me alive, not because it scares me but it actually gives me an energy to keep my day alive.
